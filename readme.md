![Deploy to WordPress.org](https://github.com/wpscholar-wp-plugins/mpress-hide-from-search/workflows/Deploy%20to%20WordPress.org/badge.svg)

## Description
The **Hide from Search** plugin allows you to hide individual WordPress pages from search engines and/or WordPress search results.

It isn't uncommon to have pages on your site that are public, but not intended to be found. Take, for example, a download page where people who have signed up for your email newsletter can download your amazing white paper.  You don't want just anyone to be able to download your white paper, but the page has to be public because people who sign up for your newsletter aren't going to be logged into your site.  You can't have people who perform a search for the title of your whitepaper finding it in search.  The solution?  Download this plugin and hide your download page from WordPress search as well as search engines!

### Pull Requests
All pull requests are welcome, although this plugin is relatively simple, so I'll probably be selective when it comes to features.
